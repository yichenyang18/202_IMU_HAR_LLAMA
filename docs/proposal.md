# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human language. However, their potential for reasoning and cognition in relation to the physical world, particularly when dealing with sensor data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remains an area of exploration. IoT devices, especially in applications like Human Activity Recognition (HAR), generate complex sensor data that LLMs could potentially process for higher-level reasoning and pattern recognition. Our project seeks to explore how LLMs can leverage this sensor data to improve understanding and classification of physical activities, while addressing key challenges such as computational resource limitations, memory usage, and latency on edge devices like smartphones.

Our goal is to assess the performance of LLMs for IMU-based HAR classification tasks on smartphones, optimizing them for resource-constrained environments. We will explore techniques such as parameter fine-tuning, prompt configuration, data augmentation, etc. to balance accuracy, latency, and memory usage. By analyzing trade-offs between model complexity and real-world performance, we aim to identify strategies that enhance classification accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment on smartphones.

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

Since the majority of sensor data is collected by edge devices, including smartphone, smart home devices, industrial IoT devices, it is convenient and intuitive to use LLMs that are deployed on these devices to analyze data and perform related tasks. In addition, since LLMs are generally very large, performance-related factors, such as latency and computational resource consumption, is also what we consider. Thus, inspired by prior works, we want to explore how we can explore and augment LLMs' reasoning from and towards real world while addressing the challenges associated with deploying them on edge devices.
